Completed Task 4: Full Project Implementation, where I brought together everything I’ve learned so far by building complete, interactive, and fully responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Designed and implemented a multi‑page responsive web application featuring a personal portfolio, an interactive to‑do list with local storage, and a shopping platform with dynamic product search, category filters, sorting, and real product images, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
